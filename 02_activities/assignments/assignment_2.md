# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...


Good Data Visualization

Title: "COVID-19 Vaccinations by Country"
Source: Our World in Data
URL: [COVID-19 Vaccinations by Country](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)

Why It's Good:


1) Clarity and Simplicity:

Design: The visualization uses a clean and simple design, making it easy to understand the percentage of the population vaccinated in different countries.
Color Use: Minimal and effective, with clear distinctions between countries.
Labels and Legends: Well-placed and clear, aiding comprehension without cluttering the visualization.

2) Interactivity:

Hover Information: Users can hover over the chart to see specific data points, which enhances engagement and understanding.
Filters: Users can filter data by country or region, allowing for dynamic exploration of the data.

3) Accuracy and Precision:

Plotting: Data points are accurately plotted, with appropriate scales on the axes, ensuring the visualization is informative and trustworthy.


4) Context and Annotations:

Significant Events: Annotations provide context for significant events (e.g., vaccine rollouts, policy changes), helping interpret data trends.


5) Improvement Suggestions
Enhance Accessibility: Add text alternatives for hover information and ensure the color scheme is color-blind friendly.










Bad Data Visualization
Title: "World's Biggest Data Breaches"
Source: Information is Beautiful
URL: [World's Biggest Data Breaches](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/)


Why It's Bad

1) Overcomplicated Design:

Clutter: The visualization is cluttered with too many colors and overlapping elements, making it difficult to discern individual data points or trends. The use of too many different shapes and sizes creates visual overload, making it hard to focus on any single piece of data.


2) Poor Labeling and Legends:

Labels are either missing or poorly placed, requiring users to guess what certain parts of the visualization represent.


3) Misleading Representations:

Inconsistent Scales: The scales used are inconsistent and non-intuitive, leading to potential misinterpretation of the data.
Area Representation: Use of area to represent values (e.g., in bubble charts) can be misleading because humans are not good at accurately judging area.

4) Lack of Context and Annotations:

No Annotations: No annotations or explanations are provided to give context for the data, making it difficult to understand the significance of certain trends or outliers.
Missing Context: Important events that could explain data breaches are missing, leaving the viewer with an incomplete understanding of the data.


5) Improvement Suggestions
Simplifying the Design: Using a cleaner, more straightforward design with appropriate use of white space to reduce clutter. A bar chart might be more effective for this data.
Improving Labeling and Legends: Ensuring all elements are clearly labeled and that the legend is easy to understand and directly linked to the data it describes.
Ensuring Accurate Representations: Using consistent scales and avoid complex visual encodings to ensure the data is represented accurately and intuitively.
Adding Context and Annotations: Including annotations for significant events and provide brief explanations to help users understand the trends and outliers in the data.





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
